# Project_CarRent

This is small desktop app made by two begginer IT students.

# **You need the following tools in order to run/edit the solution:**

- Microsoft Visual Studio (Latest recommended)
- Microsoft SQL Server (Latest recommended)
# How to run it STEP by STEP
- First of all i recommend to copy the script CarRentDatabase and in Microsoft Sql Server create a new query and just paste it in this and then execute it.
- Secondly clone this repository and open Projekt_ProgramowanieO.sln file.
- In catalog Helpers open DBHelper.cs and you'll see the following code:
